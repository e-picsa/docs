# Functions

Supabase provides Edge functions to execute code on-demand in the cloud

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
- [Deno VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)

A rest client to trigger functions, E.g.

- [Insomnia Desktop App](https://insomnia.rest), or
- [Thunder Client VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client)

## Running Locally

If developing functions locally run via

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase functions serve
```

### Authorization

Functions may expect a user to pass auth credentials with the function.
A list of available credentials can be found via

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase status
```

Output will provide keys for both anonymous and service role user

```
anon key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1N....
service_role key: eyJhbGciOiJI...
```

Either of these can be included in the headers of your http rest client when calling functions.
Usually there will be an `Auth` option with the request, use this to set a `Bearer token` with the value Output

E.g. in Insomnia:

## Develop New Functions

Supabase recommends using a smaller number of functions, where each function can serve multiple purposes

As such all functions related to a specific product, e.g. the dashboard, should be grouped into a single parent function as seen in

To add a new function simply create the `.ts` file and add a new endpoint to call that function from the main index, e.g.

_apps/picsa-server/supabase/functions/dashboard/index.ts_

```ts
switch (endpoint) {
  case "my-endpoint":
    return myFunction(req);
  // ...
}
```

_my-function.ts_

```ts
export const myFunction = async (req: Request) => {
  return new Response("it works");
};
```

To return more structured responses you may want to use the `JSONResponse` and `ErrorResponse` utility methods included locally

### Run via Rest Client

Simply make a request to the named endpoint, e.g.

```
http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/dashboard/my-function
```

### Unit Testing

Whilst serving functions tests can be executed by

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:test-functions
```

In order to run tests that connect to supabase an additional `.env.test` file should be populated in the the functions directory with SUPABASE_ANON_KEY credentials

Tests are written using the [Behavior-Driven Development](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/testing/behavior_driven_development) module

Functions cli supports [additional arguments](https://fig.io/manual/deno/test) such as `--watch`

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:test-functions --watch
```

## Production Deployment
To deploy functions first ensure supabase is logged in and linked to the production project
```sh
cd apps/picsa-server
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref [ref]
```
Where `--project-ref` is `id` of project from supabase console. If prompted for db password can leave blank

Then deploy via:
```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:deploy-functions
```

If functions require specific `Secrets` to be set ensure to update from the supabase console as required
