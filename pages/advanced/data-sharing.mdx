# Data Sharing

Many of the apps and tools need to share data which would ordinarily be hardcoded into the app.
An example of this is the list of crops used for budget, crop-probability and seasonal calendar tools.

In order to facilitate data sharing across apps, a specific `libs/data` workspace has been created which can be imported across apps.

## Data with Icons

Much of the shared data includes lists to icons that may be used within UI components.

Typically these icons would need to be registered within the custom mat-icon registry on a per-app base,
however utility methods have been included to reduce the steps required to include:

**1. Make data svg icons available to the app**

E.g. if using the `weather` data, the corresponding svgs can be imported as follows into the app `project.json` filename

```json
{ "glob": "*.svg", "input": "libs/data/weather/svgs", "output": "assets/svgs/weather" },
```

**2. Register the icons for use with `mat-icon`**

```ts
import { DataIconRegistry } from '@picsa/data';

constructor(dataIconRegistry: DataIconRegistry){
 dataIconRegistry.registerMatIcons('weather');
}
```

**3. Use within components**

```html
<mat-icon svgIcon="picsa_weather_rain" />
```
