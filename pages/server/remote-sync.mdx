## Manual Changes

### Secrets

Ensure `vault` enabled and populate secrets for:

- `project_url` - full supabase project url, used for cron-triggered functions (e.g. forecasts cron)

### Other Changes

- kobo webhook url
- secrets
- KOBO_API_KEY
- environment supabase config.json

## Troubleshooting

**ERROR: schema "supabase_functions" does not exist (SQLSTATE 3F000)**

Enable webhooks on project, go to _Project -> Database -> Webhooks -> Enable Webhooks_

**DB Pull creates unexpected storage migration**

If when running `supabase db pull` a migration file is populated with

```sql
ERROR: column objects.owner_id does not exist (SQLSTATE 42703)
At statement 0: create or replace view "public"."storage_objects" as  SELECT objects.id,
    objects.bucket_id,
    objects.name,
    objects.owner,
    objects.created_at,
    objects.updated_at,
    objects.last_accessed_at,
    objects.metadata,
    objects.path_tokens,
    objects.version,
    objects.owner_id
   FROM storage.objects
```

This implies local and server APIs are running different storage versions
https://github.com/supabase/cli/issues/1665

Short term recommended fix is to ignore the migration (delete locally and do not commit to server)

**The remote database's migration history is not in sync with the contents of supabase\migrations**

Check the db table `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`, this will list all migrations that have been applied on remote and should also exist locally

If any migrations have been removed locally (and manually reverted on db) then they should be removed from the list, e.g.

```sh
supabase migration repair --status reverted 20240116050508
```

With server migration list in sync with local it will then be possible to do a db pull operation to ensure local db matches server.

```sh
supabase db pull
```

This will create a new migration file containing the difference between server and local dbs.

It would also be a good time to test whether the local db can be recreated from scratch

```sh
supabase db reset
```
