# Server
The server backend is built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs), which provides infrastructure for database, file storage, user authentication, serverless functions and more. 

Local development requires running a self-managed supabase instance using docker containers.
Serverless functions are run using a Deno runtime environment

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
- [Deno VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)

## Quickstart

### Start Server

```sh
yarn start:server
```

This will start various backend services within docker containers

| Feature     | URI |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Studio      | http://localhost:54323         |
| API         | http://localhost:54321        |
| DB          | postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres           |
| GraphQL     | http://localhost:54321/graphql/v1         |
| Inbucket    | http://localhost:54324         |
 

**Frontend Config**   
In order for frontend apps to communicate with the server an `anon key` created by the server must be populated to local configuration.

This key can be found in the console when the server starts, or by running the script
```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase status
```
This key should be populated to `libs\environments\src\supabase\config.json`


### Create User

In order to allow communication from unauthenticated users to the database a custom anonymous user
should be created from the studio dashboard with credentials:

http://localhost:54323/project/default/auth/users

email: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`
password: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`

Ensure **Auto Confirm** is checked

## Advanced Usage

### Populate DB

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase db reset
```

### Serve Functions

If developing functions locally run via

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase functions serve
```

Functions can be called from any rest client.

Authorization credentials should be provided using the service_role key output when server started or by calling `nx run picsa-server:supabase status`

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/local-development

**Test Functions**

Whilst serving functions tests can be executed by

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:test-functions
```

In order to run tests that connect to supabase an additional `.env.local` file should be populated in the the functions directory with SUPABASE_ANON_KEY credentials

Tests are written using the [Behavior-Driven Development](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/testing/behavior_driven_development) module

Functions cli supports [additional arguments](https://fig.io/manual/deno/test) such as `--watch`

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:test-functions --watch
```

### Export DB Type Generation

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:gen-types
```

or from the console http://localhost:54323/project/default/api?page=tables-intro

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types

### Link to server

```
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase link --project-ref [ref]
```

### Pull server db

```sh
supabase db pull
```

### DB Migrations

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase migration new create_monitoring_submissions
```

This will populate a new sql file in the `migrations` folder
Update the sql as required and update local db

## Troubleshooting

**`supabase link` fails - timeout**

- Check dashboard and ensure ip not panned
- Pass password as var

```
supabase link --project-ref [ref] --password [pass]
```

**Relative import path "@supabase/supabase-js" not prefixed**
Any Imports have to be defined both in `import-map.json` file

**Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:54322 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:54322: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions**
Windows reserves some of the same ports that supabase uses. Either the supabase ports can be modified from the `config.toml` file, or windows updated to change restricted port ranges
