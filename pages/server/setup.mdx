# Server

The server backend is built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs), which provides infrastructure for database, file storage, user authentication, serverless functions and more.

Local development requires running a self-managed supabase instance using docker containers.
Serverless functions are run using a Deno runtime environment

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Quickstart

### Start Server

```sh
yarn start:server
```

This will start various backend services within docker containers

| Feature  | URI                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Studio   | http://localhost:54323                                  |
| API      | http://localhost:54321                                  |
| DB       | postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres |
| GraphQL  | http://localhost:54321/graphql/v1                       |
| Inbucket | http://localhost:54324                                  |

**Frontend Config**  
In order for frontend apps to communicate with the server an `anon key` created by the server must be populated to local configuration.

This key can be found in the console when the server starts, or by running the script

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase status
```

This key should be populated to `libs\environments\src\supabase\config.json`

### Create User

In order to allow communication from unauthenticated users to the database a custom anonymous user
should be created from the studio dashboard with credentials:

http://localhost:54323/project/default/auth/users

email: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`
password: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`

Ensure **Auto Confirm** is checked

### Stop Server

When no longer in use the server can be stopped by either stopping the container running in docker desktop, or by command

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase stop
```
