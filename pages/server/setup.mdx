# Server
The server backend is built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs), which provides infrastructure for database, file storage, user authentication, serverless functions and more. 

Local development requires running a self-managed supabase instance using docker containers.
Serverless functions are run using a Deno runtime environment

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Quickstart

### Start Server

```sh
yarn start:server
```

This will start various backend services within docker containers

| Feature     | URI |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Studio      | http://localhost:54323         |
| API         | http://localhost:54321        |
| DB          | postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres           |
| GraphQL     | http://localhost:54321/graphql/v1         |
| Inbucket    | http://localhost:54324         |
 

**Frontend Config**   
In order for frontend apps to communicate with the server an `anon key` created by the server must be populated to local configuration.

This key can be found in the console when the server starts, or by running the script
```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase status
```
This key should be populated to `libs\environments\src\supabase\config.json`


### Create User

In order to allow communication from unauthenticated users to the database a custom anonymous user
should be created from the studio dashboard with credentials:

http://localhost:54323/project/default/auth/users

email: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`
password: `anonymous_user@picsa.app`

Ensure **Auto Confirm** is checked


### Stop Server
When no longer in use the server can be stopped by either stopping the container running in docker desktop, or by command
```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase stop
```

## Troubleshooting

**Relative import path "@supabase/supabase-js" not prefixed**

Any Imports have to be defined both in `import-map.json` file

**Ports are not available exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:54322 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:54322: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions**

Windows reserves some of the same ports that supabase uses. Either the supabase ports can be modified from the `config.toml` file, or windows updated to change restricted port ranges

**Server restart fails (corrupted server)**

If the server stops working it may need a clean restart

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase stop --no-backup
```
This will stop the running container but not persist any data

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase start
```
