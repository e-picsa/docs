# Server Troubleshooting

**Relative import path "@supabase/supabase-js" not prefixed**

Any Imports have to be defined both in `import-map.json` file

**Ports are not available exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:54322 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:54322: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions**

Windows reserves some of the same ports that supabase uses. Either the supabase ports can be modified from the `config.toml` file, or windows updated to change restricted port ranges

**Server restart fails (corrupted server)**

If the server stops working it may need a clean restart

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase stop --no-backup
```

This will stop the running container but not persist any data

```sh
yarn nx run picsa-server:supabase start
```

**`supabase link` fails - timeout**

- Check dashboard and ensure ip not banned
- Use supabase cli directly
- Pass password as var

```sh
cd apps/picsa-server
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref [ref] --password [pass]
```
